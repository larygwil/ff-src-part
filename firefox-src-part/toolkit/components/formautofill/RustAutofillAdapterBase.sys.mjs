/**
 * Shared half of the Rust-backed autofill storage adapters.
 *
 * Each collection in the vendored application-services autofill `Store` is
 * presented to desktop through the subset of the `AutofillRecords` interface
 * its consumers use. Everything in that presentation which does not depend on
 * the collection lives here; a subclass supplies only what the Rust schema
 * makes specific to its own records.
 *
 * A subclass must provide, as getters rather than instance fields -- the
 * constructor below reads `_dataType`, and an instance field is not initialised
 * until after it returns:
 *
 *  - `_dataType` and `_logger`.
 *  - `_recordApi`, the shared record module that normalises and computes fields.
 *  - `_validFields`, the canonical field list.
 *
 * and as methods:
 *
 *  - `_recordFromRust()`, `_normalize()`, and the store calls listed under
 *    "Store operations". `_recordFromRust()` is handed getAll()'s options, so
 *    a collection that hides a stored field on read reports it under
 *    `rawData`; one that hides nothing ignores them.
 *
 * `static _instance = null` is worth declaring for the reader, though
 * `getInstance()` stores per subclass either way.
 *
 * A subclass may override the three merge hooks -- `_prepareStoredForMerge()`,
 * `_validateRecord()` and `_recomputeBeforeWrite()` -- which do nothing here.
