// We expect to be given a command string in argv[1], perhaps followed by other
// arguments depending on the command. The valid commands are:
// register-task [unique-token]
//   Create a Windows scheduled task that will launch this binary with the
//   do-task command every 24 hours, starting from 24 hours after register-task
//   is run. unique-token is required and should be some string that uniquely
//   identifies this installation of the product; typically this will be the
//   install path hash that's used for the update directory, the AppUserModelID,
//   and other related purposes.
// update-task [unique-token]
//   Update an existing task registration, without changing its schedule. This
//   should be called during updates of the application, in case this program
//   has been updated and any of the task parameters have changed. The unique
//   token argument is required and should be the same one that was passed in
//   when the task was registered.
// unregister-task [unique-token]
//   Removes the previously created task. The unique token argument is required
//   and should be the same one that was passed in when the task was registered.
// uninstall [unique-token]
//   Removes the previously created task, and also removes all registry entries
//   running the task may have created. The unique token argument is required
//   and should be the same one that was passed in when the task was registered.
// do-task [app-user-model-id]
//   Actually performs the default agent task, which currently means generating
//   and sending our telemetry ping and possibly showing a notification to the
//   user if their browser has switched from Firefox to Edge with Blink.
// set-default-browser-user-choice [app-user-model-id] [[.file1 ProgIDRoot1]
// ...]
//   Set the default browser via the UserChoice registry keys.  Additional
//   optional file extensions to register can be specified as additional
//   argument pairs: the first element is the file extension, the second element
//   is the root of a ProgID, which will be suffixed with `-$AUMI`.
