/**
 * votermaps.org - vertically center map icons
 * Bug #1928605 - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1928605
 * WebCompat issue #143427 - https://webcompat.com/issues/143427
 *
 * The page tells Firefox to preserve XML space, which causes the icons on their
 * maps to not vertically center correctly. We can fix that with a touch of CSS.
