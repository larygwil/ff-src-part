 * www.samsung.com - Layout shows one column instead of two on Android
 * Bug #1959132 - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1959132
 * WebCompat issue #152559 - https://webcompat.com/issues/152559
 *
 * The site is using a grid gap which is a bit too large, and Firefox
 * dutifully mis-arranges the columns as instructed. Making the gap a
 * bit smaller seems to work better across browsers.
