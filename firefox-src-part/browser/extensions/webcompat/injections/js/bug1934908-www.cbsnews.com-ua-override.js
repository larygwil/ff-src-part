/**
 * Bug 1934908 - www.cbsnews.com - Override UA on Android to use JS HLS player
 * Spoofing as Chrome forces the siteâ€™s HLS.js player. Native HLS is controlled
 * by media.hls.enabled, which defaults to false. When false, video doesn't
 * play back at all. When true, video will play back for a minute or two before
 * stopping. With this override video playback works consistently regardless of
 * how media.hls.enabled is configured.
