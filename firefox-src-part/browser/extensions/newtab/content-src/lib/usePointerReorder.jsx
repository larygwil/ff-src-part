/**
 * Pointer-driven reorder for a container whose children are placed by CSS
 * `order`. The dragged child is moved by translating the real element rather
 * than by giving the browser a picture of it to drag, so anything inside it
 * keeps rendering for the whole drag. That is why this exists instead of HTML
 * drag and drop: `setDragImage` takes that picture through
 * `PresShell::RenderNode`, which cannot paint an out-of-process iframe, so an
 * iframe child's body comes out blank.
 *
 * The dragged element carries data-dragging until its drop animation ends, and
 * the FLIP engine excludes that attribute from its childSelector. skipSelector
 * would not be enough: it only covers the part of the engine that animates,
 * while the part that measures clears inline transforms on everything it can
 * see. Leaving the dragged element visible to the engine would cancel its drop
 * animation on the next render.
 *
 * Consumers must supply CSS:
 *   the container is a flex or grid container, so that the `order` this hook
 *     sets on each item actually places it. Nothing works without this.
 *   [data-dragging] { z-index: 1; }
 *     without it the dragged item paints under its neighbours.
 *   <container>:has([data-dragging]) iframe { pointer-events: none; }
 *     insurance for embedded content. Pointer capture already keeps the drag
 *     alive over an out-of-process iframe, but only once it has been granted.
 *
 * `itemSelector` must match exactly the elements that receive getItemProps, and
 * each of them must carry the data attribute named by `idAttr`. Putting the
 * attribute on a different element fails silently. `itemSelector` is read once
 * when the FLIP engine is built, so changing it later has no effect.
