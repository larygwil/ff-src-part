    //    - breakpoints
    //    - breakpoint positions
    //    - pause location
    //    - paused frames
    //
    // Columns are 1-based in:
    //  - the UI displayed to the user (console messages, frames, stacktraces,...)
    //  - asserted locations in tests (to match displayed numbers)
    //  - Spidermonkey:
    //    This data is mostly coming from and driven by
    //    JSScript::lineno and JSScript::column

    //  - some RDP packets outside of the thread actor:
    //    - CONSOLE_MESSAGE, CSS_MESSAGE, PAGE_ERROR resources for lineNumber, columnNumber and stacktrace attributes
    //    - Error objects's Object Actor's grip's "preview" attribute will expose its stacktraces with 1-based columns
    //  - SmartTrace is dealing with these RDP packets and consumes 1-based columns,
    //    but has to map to 0-based columns as it depends on debugger frontend Frames components.
